# ADAS-Video-Stitching
This project endeavours to advance the capabilities of Advanced Driver Assistance 
Systems (ADAS) through the seamless integration of content obtained from two distinct 
camera sources. The focus lies on employing feature-based image and video stitching 
techniques to create a comprehensive and panoramic view of the surrounding 
environment, contributing to enhanced safety and functionality in the realm of ADAS.

The project utilizes the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm for key 
point detection and description, allowing for efficient feature extraction from frames 
captured by separate camera sources. The developed system aligns with feature-based 
image stitching approaches, which offer robustness against scene movement and 
automatic discovery of overlapping relationships among frames. This methodology not 
only facilitates the creation of high-resolution panoramic images but extends to video 
stitching, providing a dynamic and continuous perspective.
